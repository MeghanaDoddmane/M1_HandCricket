I am completing this project within 31st of March.

End user: Students, People of any age.

How it works?: It's a two player game hand game where they alternate being a batsman and a bo wler. Who decides to do what initially is determined by a tossUntil a player Won the toss Follow the Output and give whatever it asks you to give Then the Player who won the toss chooses either to Bat or to Bowl The Player who chose batting and bowling has to proceed by pressing enter Key one by one Where System will generate Random number as runs for both players.Player 1 runs keeps on adding until his runs equals to player 2 runs Finally When Player 1 is Out.Till then his runs are his final Score.The Same process will be Conducted for player 2.

Finally whoever is having Highest Score is the Winner.

For Example: Player 1 Won the Toss And Chose Batting.Then When Player 1 Press Enter Key,A score will be generated for Player 1
Suppose runs are 5 So Player 1 Score=5.Then Player 2 Also Presses Enter key.Then if he got a Score of 4.So Player 2 Score =4
As Player 1 Score is not equal to player 2 Score Then Player 1 is not out and hi score will be 5 after 1st ball
In 2nd ball Player 1 got 3 runs and Player 2 got 4.Since again both are not equal.Player 1 Score=5+3=8
If in the 3rd Ball Player 1 got 4 runs and Player 2 also got 4 runs Then Player 1 Score is equal to Player 2's Score Then Player 1 is Out
Then Final Score of player 1 is 8 runs.
The Same Process is done for Player 2.So Finaly who ever got more score is Winner.
